This is a major extension to the sixth main release of TiMBL.
Most significant change: The main program is now called 'timbl' and not 
'Timbl' anymore. Be warned!
This change is part of our effort to get our MBL software into software 
distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat and Fink (Mac OSX).

While this is NOT a Beta version it may still contain some bugs or
behave not exactly as documented or expected. Comments and
bug-reports are welcome at: timbl@uvt.nl. Updates and more info
may be found on http://ilk.uvt.nl/timbl .
