6.4.1 2011-xx-xx

[ Ko van der Sloot ]
- added Version() and VersionName() functions. We want them for every
  member of the family
- fixed a problem with normalization on empty distributions.
- added a Confidence( class ) function to the instances API.
  returns the Weight of 'class'. Which is influenced by normalization!

- the +vS option was not always honoured. Now Timbl shuts it's big mouth better
- Expand() is now also enabled for TRIBL and TRIBL2

- decapped Timbl and libTimbl to timbl and libtimbl
  this will shake the whole timbl family tree!
- small fixes to survive -pedantic compiler option without warnings

6.3.4
- we now support incremental learning from a file on the command line.
- implemented a --clones option to use multiple threads for testing
- fixed bug 58. Emit Error when reading an InstanceBase without a test.
- fixed bug 61. Give a Warning when a trainingset contains only 1 class.
- cleaned up build system

6.3.2
- fixed bug 44. Segfault in weird cases
- fixed bug 45. Needless processing of traindata when required option is missing
